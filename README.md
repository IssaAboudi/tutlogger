# tutlogger
As an LPC tutor I needed a cleaner way to keep track of the sessions I've done on a particular day


**Instructions to build yourself:**

You'll need to make sure you have MinGW installed (you can download from https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) and that you have your path set in Windows to use the compiler

Run the following two commands

g++ -c *.cpp

g++ -o Tutoring.exe *.o

on Windows

The program will generate a text file which you'll keep adding to.

**Download:**

You can also download a precompiled executable under Releases
https://github.com/IssaAboudi/tutlogger/releases

As of 12/16/2021 there is only a Windows executable avaliable, I will add more soon
