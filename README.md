## TutLogger by (Matthew) Issa Aboudi
As an LPC tutor I wanted a more convenient way to keep track of the tutees I have, and the sessions I have done on a particular day. I initially made this purely to keep track of hours.

Application is completely terminal based as of 1/5/2022, but I am working on turning this into a cross platform GUI (graphical user interface) application.

**Libraries & Toolkits used:**

- Nlohmann JSON library for saving and loading data locally (Found here: https://github.com/nlohmann/json)

- Ocornut Dear ImGui library for the GUI application (Found here: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)

- VCPKG is a C/C++ Package Manager from Microsoft (Found here: https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html)

**Download:**

* The project includes a makefile which you can use to generate a linux executable - CONSOLE ONLY
    * Mac and Windows - not implemented as of 1/5/2022


* You can also download a precompiled executable under Releases
