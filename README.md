As an LPC tutor I needed a cleaner way to keep track of the sessions I've done on a particular day

Instructions to setup for yourself:

You'll need to make sure you have MinGW installed (you can download from https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) and that you have your path set in Windows to use the compiler

Run the following two commands
*g++ -c *.cpp
*g++ -o Tutoring.exe *.o

on Windows

The program will generate a text file which you'll keep adding to.
